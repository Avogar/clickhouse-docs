# Defining SQL Users and Roles

This article shows the basics of defining SQL users and roles then applying privileges and permissions to databases, tables, rows and columns.

## Admin role

<Tabs groupId="deployMethod">
<TabItem value="serverless" label="ClickHouse Cloud" default>


In ClickHouse Cloud there is no Superuser as there is available for on-prem installations.
The `default` user has the most privileges but this account also has some restrictions on the system databases.

The following are steps to create a similar admin role and user to the default user:

### Create an admin role:

The role is created, and then privileges are granted to the role:
```sql
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS admin_role;
```

Grant privileges that apply to all databases, tables and ClickHouse objects.  This will allow users with the admin_role to create other users, databases, etc.  Review these privileges and remove any that are not acceptable to you:
```sql
GRANT
  SELECT,
  CREATE DATABASE,
  CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE,
  CREATE USER,
  ALTER USER, 
  DROP USER, 
  CREATE ROLE, 
  ALTER ROLE, 
  DROP ROLE, 
  ROLE ADMIN,
  CREATE QUOTA, 
  ALTER QUOTA, 
  DROP QUOTA, 
  SHOW USERS, 
  SHOW ROLES,
  SHOW QUOTAS, 
  SYSTEM DROP CACHE, 
  SYSTEM RELOAD CONFIG, 
  SYSTEM RELOAD DICTIONARY, 
  SYSTEM RELOAD MODEL, 
  SYSTEM RELOAD FUNCTION, 
  SYSTEM RELOAD EMBEDDED DICTIONARIES, 
  SYSTEM SYNC REPLICA, 
  SYSTEM RESTART REPLICA, 
  SYSTEM SYNC DATABASE REPLICA, 
  SYSTEM FLUSH, 
  URL, 
  REMOTE, 
  S3 
ON *.*
TO admin_role WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

### Grants for user databases

The following grants must be issued to each user database (db1, db2, etc.)

:::tip
Create your database(s) for individual projects before assigning the admin role.  The example commands below use `db1`.
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db1
```
:::

```sql
GRANT
  INSERT,
  ALTER,
  ALTER ROW POLICY,
  DROP DATABASE,
  CREATE TABLE,
  DROP TABLE,
  TRUNCATE,
  OPTIMIZE,
  CREATE ROW POLICY, 
  ALTER ROW POLICY, 
  DROP ROW POLICY, 
  SHOW ROW POLICIES
ON 
db1.*
TO admin_role WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

:::tip
As new databases get added the `default` account will need to be used to add privileges to the `admin_role`.  Fir example, if `db2` gets created and users with the admin_role should be able to manage `db2`, then run the above grant again substituting `db2` for `db1`:
```sql
ON
# highlight-next-line
db2.*
TO admin_role WITH GRANT OPTION;
```
:::

### Create an admin user and assign the admin role:

Create a user `admin_user`:
```sql
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS admin_user IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_password BY 'ClickHouse_123';
```

Add the admin user to the admin role:
```sql
GRANT admin_role TO admin_user;
```
### Log in to your ClickHouse Cloud service as the new user
Test the admin_user login
```bash
./clickhouse client --host <clickhouse_cloud_url> --secure --port 9440 --user admin_user --password 'ClickHouse_123'
```


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="selfmanaged" label="Self-managed">

### Enabling SQL user mode

1.  Enable SQL user mode in the `users.xml` file under the `<default>` user:
    ```xml
    <access_management>1</access_management>
    ```

    :::note
    The `default` user is the only user that gets created with a fresh install and is also the account used for internode communications, by default.

    In production, it is recommended to disable this user once the inter-node commnication has been configured with a SQL admin user and inter-node communications have been set with `<secret>`, cluster credentials and/or internode http and transport protocol credentials since the `default` account is used for internode communication.
    :::

2. Restart the nodes to apply the changes.

3. Start the ClickHouse client:
    ```sql
    clickhouse-client --user default --password <password>
    ```
### Create an admin user and assign the admin role

1. Create a SQL administrator account:
    ```sql
    CREATE USER clickhouse_admin IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    ```
2. Grant the new user full administrative rights
    ```sql
    GRANT ALL ON *.* TO clickhouse_admin WITH GRANT OPTION;
    ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Test admin privileges

All of these should succeed:

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR admin_role;
```

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR admin_user;
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE db1.table1 (id UInt64, column1 String) ENGINE = MergeTree() ORDER BY id;
```

```sql
INSERT INTO db1.table1 (id, column1) VALUES (1, 'abc');
```

```sql
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS regular_user IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_password BY 'password';
```

```sql
DROP TABLE db1.table1;
```

```sql
DROP USER regular_user;
```
3. Create regular user to restrict columns
    ```sql
    CREATE USER column_user IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    ```

4. Create a regular user to restrict by row values
    ```sql
    CREATE USER row_user IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    ```

### Creating a sample database, table and rows

1. Create a test database
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE db1;
    ```

2. Create a table
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE db1.table1 (
        id UInt64,
        column1 String,
        column2 String
    )
    ENGINE MergeTree
    ORDER BY id;
    ```

3. Populate the table with sample rows
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO db1.table1
        (id, column1, column2)
    VALUES
        (1, 'A', 'abc'),
        (2, 'A', 'def'),
        (3, 'B', 'abc'),
        (4, 'B', 'def');
    ```

4. Verify the table:
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM db1.table1
    ```

    ```response
    Query id: 475015cc-6f51-4b20-bda2-3c9c41404e49

    ┌─id─┬─column1─┬─column2─┐
    │  1 │ A       │ abc     │
    │  2 │ A       │ def     │
    │  3 │ B       │ abc     │
    │  4 │ B       │ def     │
    └────┴─────────┴─────────┘
    ```

## Creating restrictive roles
With this set of examples, roles for different privileges such as columns and rows will be created, privileges will be granted to the roles and users will be assigned to each role. Roles are used to define groups of users for certain privileges instead of managing each user seperately.
1.  Create a role to restrict users of this role to only see `column1` in database `db1` and `table1`:
    ```sql
    CREATE ROLE column1_users;
    ```

2. Set privileges to allow view on `column1`
    ```sql
    GRANT SELECT(id, column1) ON db1.table1 TO column1_users;
    ```

3. Add the `column_user` user to the `column1_users` role
    ```sql
    GRANT column1_users TO column_user;
    ```

4. Create a role to restrict users of this role to only see selected rows, in this case only rows containing `A` in `column1`
    ```sql
    CREATE ROLE A_rows_users;
    ```

5. Add the `row_user` to the `A_rows_users` role
    ```sql
    GRANT A_rows_users TO row_user;
    ```

5. Create a policy to allow view on only where `column1` has the values of `A`
    ```sql
    CREATE ROW POLICY A_row_filter ON db1.table1 FOR SELECT USING column1 = 'A' TO A_rows_users;
    ```

6. Set privileges to the database and table
    ```sql
    GRANT SELECT(id, column1, column2) ON db1.table1 TO A_rows_users;
    ```

7. grant explicit permissions for other roles to still have access to all rows
    ```sql
    CREATE ROW POLICY allow_other_users_filter ON db1.table1 FOR SELECT USING 1 TO clickhouse_admin, column1_users;
    ```

    :::note
    When attaching a policy to a table, the system will apply that policy and only those users and roles defined will be able to do operations on the table, all others will be denied any operations.
    In order to not have the restrictive row policy applied to other users, another policy must be defined to allow other users and roles to have regular or other types of access.
    :::

## Testing restrictive role privileges

### Testing role privileges with column restricted user

1. Log into the clickhouse client using the `clickhouse_admin` user
    ```
    clickhouse-client --user clickhouse_admin --password password
    ```

2. Verify access to database, table and all rows with the admin user.
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM db1.table1
    ```

    ```response
    Query id: f5e906ea-10c6-45b0-b649-36334902d31d

    ┌─id─┬─column1─┬─column2─┐
    │  1 │ A       │ abc     │
    │  2 │ A       │ def     │
    │  3 │ B       │ abc     │
    │  4 │ B       │ def     │
    └────┴─────────┴─────────┘
    ```

3. Log into the ClickHouse client using the `column_user` user
    ```
    clickhouse-client --user column_user --password password
    ```

4. Test `SELECT` using all columns
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM db1.table1
    ```

    ```response
    Query id: 5576f4eb-7450-435c-a2d6-d6b49b7c4a23

    0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.006 sec.

    Received exception from server (version 22.3.2):
    Code: 497. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: column_user: Not enough privileges. To execute this query it's necessary to have grant SELECT(id, column1, column2) ON db1.table1. (ACCESS_DENIED)
    ```

    :::note
    Access is denied since all columns were specified and the user only has access to `id` and `column1`
    :::

4. Verify `SELECT` query with only columns specified and allowed:
    ```sql
    SELECT
        id,
        column1
    FROM db1.table1
    ```

    ```response
    Query id: cef9a083-d5ce-42ff-9678-f08dc60d4bb9

    ┌─id─┬─column1─┐
    │  1 │ A       │
    │  2 │ A       │
    │  3 │ B       │
    │  4 │ B       │
    └────┴─────────┘
    ```

### Testing role privileges with row restricted user

1. Log into the ClickHouse client using `row_user`
    ```
    clickhouse-client --user row_user --password password
    ```

2. View rows available
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM db1.table1
    ```

    ```response
    Query id: a79a113c-1eca-4c3f-be6e-d034f9a220fb

    ┌─id─┬─column1─┬─column2─┐
    │  1 │ A       │ abc     │
    │  2 │ A       │ def     │
    └────┴─────────┴─────────┘
    ```

## Modifying Users and Roles

Users can be assigned multiple roles for a combination of privileges needed. When using multiple roles, the system will combine the roles to determine privileges, the net effect will be that the role permissions will be cumulative.

For example, if one `role1` allows for only select on `column1` and `role2` allows for select on `column1` and `column2` then the user will have access to both columns.

1. Using the admin account, create new user to restrict by both row and column with default roles
    ```sql
    CREATE USER row_and_column_user IDENTIFIED BY 'password' DEFAULT ROLE A_rows_users;
    ```

2. Remove prior privileges for `A_rows_users` role
    ```sql
    REVOKE SELECT(id, column1, column2) ON db1.table1 FROM A_rows_users;
    ```

3. Allow `A_row_users` role to only select from `column1`
    ```sql
    GRANT SELECT(id, column1) ON db1.table1 TO A_rows_users;
    ```

4. Log into the ClickHouse client using `row_and_column_user`
    ```
    clickhouse-client --user row_and_column_user --password password;
    ```

5. Test with all columns:
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM db1.table1
    ```

    ```response
    Query id: 8cdf0ff5-e711-4cbe-bd28-3c02e52e8bc4


    0 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.005 sec.

    Received exception from server (version 22.3.2):
    Code: 497. DB::Exception: Received from localhost:9000. DB::Exception: row_and_column_user: Not enough privileges. To execute this query it's necessary to have grant SELECT(id, column1, column2) ON db1.table1. (ACCESS_DENIED)
    ```

6. Test with limited allowed columns:
    ```sql
    SELECT
        id,
        column1
    FROM db1.table1
    ```

    ```response
    Query id: 5e30b490-507a-49e9-9778-8159799a6ed0

    ┌─id─┬─column1─┐
    │  1 │ A       │
    │  2 │ A       │
    └────┴─────────┘
    ```

7. Examples on how to delete privileges, policies, unassign users from roles, delete users and roles:
    * Remove privilege from a role
    ```sql
    REVOKE SELECT(column1, id) ON db1.table1 FROM A_rows_users;
    ```

    * Delete a policy
    ```sql
    DROP ROW POLICY A_row_filter ON db1.table1;
    ```

    * Unassign a user from a role
    ```sql
    REVOKE A_rows_users FROM row_user;
    ```

    * Delete a role
    ```sql
    DROP ROLE A_rows_users;
    ```

    * Delete a user
    ```sql
    DROP USER row_user;
    ```

## Troubleshooting

1. There are occasions when privileges intersect or combine to produce unexpected results, the following commands can be used to narrow the issue using an admin account
    * Listing the grants and roles for a user
    ```sql
    SHOW GRANTS FOR row_and_column_user
    ```

    ```response
    Query id: 6a73a3fe-2659-4aca-95c5-d012c138097b

    ┌─GRANTS FOR row_and_column_user───────────────────────────┐
    │ GRANT A_rows_users, column1_users TO row_and_column_user │
    └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    ```

    * List roles in ClickHouse
    ```sql
    SHOW ROLES
    ```

    ```response
    Query id: 1e21440a-18d9-4e75-8f0e-66ec9b36470a

    ┌─name────────────┐
    │ A_rows_users    │
    │ column1_users   │
    └─────────────────┘
    ```

    * Display the policies
    ```sql
    SHOW ROW POLICIES
    ```

    ```response
    Query id: f2c636e9-f955-4d79-8e80-af40ea227ebc

    ┌─name───────────────────────────────────┐
    │ A_row_filter ON db1.table1             │
    │ allow_other_users_filter ON db1.table1 │
    └────────────────────────────────────────┘
    ```

    * View how a policy was defined and current privileges
    ```sql
    SHOW CREATE ROW POLICY A_row_filter ON db1.table1
    ```

    ```response
    Query id: 0d3b5846-95c7-4e62-9cdd-91d82b14b80b

    ┌─CREATE ROW POLICY A_row_filter ON db1.table1────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ CREATE ROW POLICY A_row_filter ON db1.table1 FOR SELECT USING column1 = 'A' TO A_rows_users │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    ```
